#### Introduction 
Requirements : 
Android studio 3.0

##### Owner description: 
The project is intended for an expert audience, it's written entirely in kotlin and it has lint = 0. The idea is to use MVP in combination with streams of events (handled with reactive). The kotlin-esque language allows for a perfect combination with the functional style programming language

Anko is used (for better performances and style)
KodeIn is a light framework entirely written in kotlin for better perfomance.

Note for the reviewer: in Robolectric 3.4.2 the Build config is automatically detected
unfortunately Robolectric is still not compatible with android studio
git issue: [issue link](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/3184)
Although some of the tests added classes will fail for this reason, this code will suffice as a showcase
